## CPP Meeting 3 - 21/02/25

#### Feedback:
- **Anshu:**
  - Vector dimensions for the created embeddings
  - Figure out how to obtain meaningful interpretation for CPU usage
  - Have different embeddings generators to embed and benchmark them
- **Vishal:**
  - More records in the database
  - Try benchmarking on more queries
- **Ajay:**
  - Have custom scripts for benchmarking and compare that with standard benchmarking tools
- **Namita:**
  - Understand how psutil works for the negative memory and CPU usage data
  - How brute force works better than other indexing methods
- **Varshini:**
  - Add more queries
  - Plot graphs
- **Smera:**
  - Remove all unnecessary API calls to reduce overhead
  - Visualize the metrics obtained

#### Team AAIs:
- Work with different embeddings- not just sentenceTransformers
  - Each person takes 3-4 unique ones
- Try measuring CPU usage, memory, and latency with different embeddings and interpret results
- More operations on data- not just loading into database
  - CRUD operations
  - Impact of these on query performance
  - What would large updates/deletions/insertions do to the queries?

#### Next meetings:
- **March 4th update via mail:**
  - No meeting that week
  - Post-mail update: feedback + next set of AAIs
- **Online meeting on March 19th (Wednesday)**
