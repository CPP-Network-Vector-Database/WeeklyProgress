ALBERT- Combines all features to text to generate embeddings

DistilBERT has been compared with generating embeddings as- Combining all features as text format and Converting all features as numerical values
Where the first method has shown better results with lower latency,as text format is the default format of DistilBERT to handle embeddings.

ELECTRA- Combined text format handling to generate embeddings.

DistilBERT was found to be the fastest in querying the same results of Number of frequently used Source IP addresses.


Multiple queries has been thus added to DistilBERT embeddings to retreive different results.
