## Setting Up Milvus with Faiss Indexing

These steps outline how to set up Milvus with Faiss indexing for efficient vector similarity search:

1.  **Navigate to the Milvus Directory:**

    ```
    cd milvus
    ```

2.  **List Directory Contents:**

    ```
    ls
    ```
    (This command confirms the presence of necessary files like `docker-compose.yml`- get that from the official website: https://milvus.io/docs/v2.0.x/install_standalone-docker.md)

4.  **Check Docker Status (Optional):**

    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    (This is optional, to check if any containers are already running.)

5.  **Start Milvus with Docker Compose:**

    ```
    sudo docker-compose up -d
    ```
    (This command starts all the Milvus components defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode.)

6.  **Verify Milvus Containers are Running:**

    ```
    docker ps
    ```
    (This command confirms that the `milvus-etcd`, `milvus-minio`, and `milvus-standalone` containers are up and running.)

7.  **Run the Milvus with Faiss Python Script:**

    ```
    python3 milvis_x_faiss.py
    ```
    (This script demonstrates Milvus with Faiss indexing.)

8.  **Run the Milvus with IPFLOW and Faiss Python Script:**

    ```
    python3 milvus_x_ipflow_faiss.py
    ```
    (This script demonstrates Milvus with IPFLOW and Faiss indexing.)

### Why Faiss with Milvus?

Milvus is a powerful vector database, but indexing is crucial for performance, especially with large datasets. Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that provides efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

**Benefits of using Faiss with Milvus:**

-   **Accelerated Search:**
  -   Faiss provides optimized indexing algorithms that significantly speed up vector similarity searches within Milvus.
  -   Without indexing, Milvus would have to compare the query vector against every vector in the database, which is slow for large collections.
-   **Scalability:**
  - Faiss allows Milvus to handle larger datasets more efficiently by organizing vectors into searchable indexes.
*   **Various Indexing Methods:**
  - Faiss offers a variety of indexing techniques (We've used Flat, IVF, HNSW) that can be chosen based on the specific requirements of data and search performance needs.
  - The scripts demonstrate how different Faiss indexes compare in terms of indexing and search time.

**With Random Numeric Data:**

**With Randomly Generated IP Flows:**

Clearly, we can see that ALL faiss indexing methods work better than Milvus!
